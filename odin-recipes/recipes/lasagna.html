       <p>Lasagna originally referred to the pot in which the food was cooked, but nowadays it is know by
         many as the almost pie-like pasta dish that we have as comfort food from time to time. With it's 
         wide, flat sheets of pasta, it's robust sauce and creamy ricotta cheese, it's no wonder why it's a fan favorite</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Mash your canned or fresh tomatoes in a pot with sugar to tame acidity</li>
                    <li>Chop up your red bell pepper(s) and sautee on medium heat with olive oil until soft</li>
                    <li>Add your sautee'd red bell pepper(s), fresh parsley, basil, garlic and tomato paste to your mashed tomatoes.
                        Allow this mixture to simmer on low until the flavors of each component are through-out what will be our tomatoe sauce</li>
                    <li>Boil your lasagna noodle and add salt and olive oil to the water. Cook to your preffered firmness/softness</li>
                    <li>Pan cook your ground beef and add salt and garlic to the pan</li>
                    <li>Once each component is finsihed cooking, assemble your lasagna in a viable pan. 
                        Add sauce to the bottom, noodles, sauce again and then one after the other, lay the beef, ricotta cheese and another noodle layer until you have multiple layers</li>
                    <li>Now that we've layered those components, add the mozzarella and parmesan cheese on top (the parmigiano reggiano will serve as a finishing cheese)</li>
                    <li>Put your pan of lasagna in the oven at 375F for 30-45 minutes</li>
                    <li>Once your lasagna is finished cooking, add the parmigiano reggiano, allow the lasagna to rest and then serve</li>
